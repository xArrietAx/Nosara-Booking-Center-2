## The Legend  
Nosara was a princess of extraordinary beauty, the daughter of Nicoa, the great Chorotega chief. Her grace and kindness made her beloved among her people. Curime, a young man admired for his skills in the ball game and his strength as a hunter and farmer, captured her heart.  

Their love blossomed during the Sun and Corn Festivals, celebrated in the Nicoya plaza. However, another suitor, Nacaome, a fierce warrior from Chira Island, sought Nosara's hand. Despite his lavish gifts, Nosara’s heart belonged to Curime.  

A rivalry emerged, culminating in a challenge: a ball game where the loser would leave the land and renounce Nosara. Confident in his abilities, Curime accepted.  

The match was intense, with the entire community watching in anticipation. But at a critical moment, Nacaome resorted to deceit, attacking Curime out of jealousy and anger. Tragically, Curime succumbed to his injuries.  

Devastated by the loss of her true love, Nosara chose to take her own life to reunite with Curime in the afterlife.
