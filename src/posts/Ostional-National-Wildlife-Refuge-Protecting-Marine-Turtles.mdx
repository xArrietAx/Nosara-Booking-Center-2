## Ostional National Wildlife Refuge

Ostional National Wildlife Refuge, located on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, is one of the most important sites for marine turtle conservation. This refuge, established in 1984, protects the area where thousands of turtles, especially the olive ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), come to nest. During the nesting season, Ostional becomes an impressive natural spectacle, offering a unique experience for nature and wildlife enthusiasts.

###### A Sanctuary for Turtles

Each year, from July to December, Ostional receives thousands of olive ridley turtles that come to its beaches to nest. The mass arrival of turtles, known as "arribada," can include anywhere from dozens to thousands of individuals, creating a fascinating phenomenon for observers and scientists. This event is crucial for the preservation of the species, as each turtle will deposit between 80 to 100 eggs in the sand.

###### Why Ostional is Important

The refuge not only protects the marine turtles during their nesting period but also regulates the sustainable harvesting of the eggs. Through a controlled system, local communities are allowed to collect turtle eggs ethically, ensuring that the hatchlings are allowed to emerge and develop, while also providing income to families in the area.

###### Conservation and Education

Conservation efforts at Ostional involve not only protecting the turtles but also educating the community and visitors. Educational programs help raise awareness about the importance of marine conservation and the impact of responsible tourism.

If you're looking for a unique nature experience and want to contribute to the conservation of one of Costa Rica's most iconic species, a visit to Ostional National Wildlife Refuge is an excellent choice.
