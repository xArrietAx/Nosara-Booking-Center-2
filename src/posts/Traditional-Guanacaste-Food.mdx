## Signature Dishes of Guanacaste

**1. Arroz de Maíz**  
This iconic dish is made with dried corn, cooked with pork or chicken, achiote, vegetables, and spices. It is a comforting meal often served at family gatherings and festive occasions.  

**2. Olla de Carne**  
A hearty stew featuring beef and a variety of vegetables, including yuca, ñampí, chayote, corn, and plantain. This dish is both nutritious and flavorful, making it a staple in Guanacaste homes.  

**3. Tortillas de Maíz**  
Thick, hand-made corn tortillas are a Guanacaste classic. They are often paired with fresh cheese, cuajada, or refried beans for a simple yet satisfying meal.

These finely chopped vegetable dishes—made with ingredients like chayote, potatoes, or arracache—are seasoned and served alongside rice and tortillas, embodying the simplicity of traditional cooking.

A creamy drink made with ground corn, milk, sugar, and cinnamon. This comforting beverage is enjoyed hot or cold, often as a midday treat.
